# WXCOMMAND-PRO UI design system

The web UI (and the Mac app's window, which shows the same pages) uses one
design system. Its approach follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and
Material Design 3: clear hierarchy, system fonts, generous spacing, status
shown in words rather than color alone, and motion only where it explains a
change. It is styled as an operations console: dark by default, calm, and
dense enough for a monitoring wall.

## Files

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `app/web/static/wx.css` | Tokens (color, spacing, type, radius, motion), base styles, layout, components, screen helpers |
| `app/web/static/wx.js` | Theme switch, navigation drawer, confirmation dialog, toasts, live status bar, unsaved-changes tracking, checkbox pickers |
| `app/web/static/htmx.min.js` | htmx 2.0.4, vendored (npm integrity verified) so the UI works offline |
| `app/web/templates/base.html` | App shell: sidebar navigation, status bar, dialog, toast host |
| `app/web/templates/_ui.html` | Macros: `icon`, `badge`, `empty`, `protocol_label`, `conn_label` |
| `app/web/templates/_icons.html` | One inline SVG icon sprite (24px grid, 1.8px rounded stroke) |

Static files are served at `/static`. Their URLs carry a content hash
(`?v=…`), so an upgrade never shows stale styling. Both PyInstaller specs
ship `app/web/static`.

## Tokens

- **Color roles:** `--bg`, `--bg-elev`, `--surface`, `--surface-2/3`,
  `--border`, `--text`, `--text-2`, `--text-3`, `--accent`, plus `success`,
  `warning`, `danger` and `info`, each with a `-soft` tint. Screens use these
  roles only, never hex values. Secondary and tertiary text meet WCAG AA on
  cards in both themes.
- **Themes:** dark (default) and light. The default follows the system
  setting. The status-bar button cycles System → Light → Dark, and the choice
  is remembered per browser and applied before first paint, so there is no
  flash.
- **Spacing:** a 4px scale, `--sp-1` (4) to `--sp-10` (40).
- **Type:** the system font stack in `rem`, so it follows browser and system
  text scaling. Steps: xs 12, sm 13, md 15, lg 17, xl 22, 2xl 28.
- **Shape:** radius `sm` 6, `md` 10, `lg` 14, `pill`.
- **Motion:** 120–200ms ease-out, all of it off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Targets:** controls are at least 40px tall, and 44px on touch screens.

## Components

- **Layout:** card (header, body, footer, inset), stat tile, page header with
  actions, grids.
- **Status and data:** badge (with tones, and alert-decision variants), list
  row (`item`), device row, table, chips.
- **Controls:**
  - Button: primary, secondary, ghost, danger and danger-outline, plus small
    and icon-only sizes, with a built-in spinner that shows while htmx is busy.
  - Field: label, help text, input, select, textarea, and input group.
  - Switch, checkbox, and the checkbox picker grid (filter, select all/clear,
    count).
  - Disclosure, for advanced options; segmented control; popover menu.
- **Feedback:** banner (info, success, warning, danger), empty state, result
  block, skeleton loader, toast, and modal confirmation dialog.
- **Page-level:** server-unreachable bar, sticky unsaved-changes action bar.

## Navigation

The sidebar has three groups. Below 860px it becomes a drawer behind a menu
button.

- **Monitor:** Operator Center, Dashboard
- **Alerts & activity:** Weather alerts, Public safety alerts, Transmit log,
  Send a message
- **Setup:** Settings, Radios, Bluetooth scan, Troubleshoot

A status bar on every page shows system health, radios online, and whether
the app is broadcasting live or paused (dry run). It is driven by one shared
15-second poll of `/api/ux/overview`, which pauses while the window is hidden.
The Operator Center reuses the same poll instead of making its own.

## Safety rules carried by the UI

Every action that transmits over the air, changes broadcast mode, or deletes
data asks first, through the styled dialog (`hx-confirm` or `WX.confirm`):

- Manual send (shown as a danger confirmation)
- Resend
- Radio tests
- Go live and Pause
- Clear errors
- Delete or activate a saved profile

A test (`tests/test_ui_design_system.py`) guards that the over-the-air
controls keep their confirmation.

## Adding a screen

1. Extend `base.html` and set `{% block title %}`.
2. Start with a `page-header` (h1, a one-line `lede`, and `page-actions`).
3. Build the content from `card` sections. Use `item` lists for records,
   `badge` for state (always with words), and `empty(...)` when there is no
   data.
4. Put advanced options in a `details.disclosure`.
5. Add the route to the `nav(...)` list in `base.html`.
